## Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller)

It is a framework within the broader Spring Framework, designed for building web applications in Java. It follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern to separate an application into three interconnected components, allowing for a clean and structured approach to developing web applications. Here's a brief explanation of each component:

## Model: 
The model represents the application's data and business logic. It manages data and the rules for updating or processing it. In Spring MVC, the model is typically represented by Java objects or POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).

## View: 
The view is responsible for presenting the data to the user and receiving user input. In Spring MVC, views are often created using technologies like JSP (JavaServer Pages), Thymeleaf, or FreeMarker. They render the data and provide the user interface.

## Controller: 
The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and view. It processes incoming requests from users, interacts with the model to retrieve or manipulate data, and decides which view to display to the user. Controllers are typically implemented as Java classes in Spring MVC.

Spring MVC provides a comprehensive framework for building web applications, with features like request mapping, form handling, validation, and more. It's highly configurable and can be integrated with other technologies, such as Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
